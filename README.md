Social Cube
============

This was a project done in 30hrs during HackMIT2013. The challenge was to create everything using native HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. We managed to create the cube and everything in 3D using only the above languages and I used Google, SoundCloud, Wunderground and Youtube APIs to make the cube interactive.

> Note : Since it was during a hackathon, we didn't have time to adapt it to every browser so it only works in Firefox for now. Moreover, > We only implemented 4 faces because we didn't have time to do the 2 others but we will add modifications soon.
