Social Cube :

This was a project realized in 30h at the HackMIT.
The challenge was to create everything using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
I managed to create the cube and everythinh in 3D using only the above
languages and I used the google, soundclouc, wunderground and youtube api's
to make the cube interactive.

Note : Since it was during a hackathon, I didn't have time to adapt it to
every browsers so it only works in Firefox for now. Moreover, I only implemented
4 faces because I didn't have time to do the 2 others but I will add modifications
soon.
